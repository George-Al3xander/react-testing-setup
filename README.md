# Testing Environment Setup for React.js/Next.js

This package automates the setup of a testing environment for React.js or Next.js projects, including TypeScript and ESLint configuration.

## Usage

Run the package setup command using npx:

```bash
npx setup-react-testing
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your testing environment:

1. Choose whether to use TypeScript.
2. Select the framework (React.js or Next.js).
3. Decide whether to set up ESLint with eslint-plugin-jest.
4. Wait for the installation of dependencies.

Once the setup is complete, you can start writing tests for your React.js/Next.js application.
